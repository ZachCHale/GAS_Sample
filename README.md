### Summary:
This is a Sample Project representing a minimalistic prototype for a game that plays similar to "Vampire Survivors". The game is compatible with multiplayer and demonstrates the use of the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) in a small scope project. In its current state, the project has the potential to be used as a foundation to build a game and I may explore this after finishing the remaining major features and polishing what I have.

### Controls:
- Click and hold left mouse button to attack.
- Use W A S D keys to move.
- Tab to Pause Game

### Multiplayer:
To test multiplayer on a single machine, load two instances of the executable.
Have one instance choose the "Host" option from the main menu.
The other can choose the "Join" option, then submit the default ip listed, or "localhost".
Connecting to an outside IP should be possible, but may require the host to port forward in their router settings. (Default Port: 7777)
